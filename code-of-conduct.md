# Reskill Americans Code of Conduct

**Updated March 1, 2021**

The participants of Reskill Americans come from many diverse backgrounds.  We want everyone's experience to be welcoming and positive.  So, please abide by these guidelines when communicating on the Slack Workspace and in your other interactions with your fellow students.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

We encourage you to choose a user name that is your real name, rather than a "handle".  But we understand that some may not feel comfortable doing so at this time.   In any event, please be sure that the name you use could not be construed to be derogatory to any person or group.  Thanks!

If you believe someone in our community is not adhering to these standards, please report it to info@reskillamericans.org.  We will take appropriate action which could include loss of access to this Workspace or removal from the program.
