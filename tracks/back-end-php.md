## Week 2 Courses (March 21 - 27)

This week participants begin working with the [Learning Managment System (LMS)](https://reskillamericans.us).

- **Introduction to PHP**<br>
  *PHP is the classic language for web servers - it's the original "P" in the [LAMP-stack](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/what-is-a-lamp-stack) acronym (Linux/Apache Web Server/MySQL/PHP).  I believe it is still
  used by Facebook and many other web applications (though with lots of
  optimizations thrown in).*

  This course gets you setup with VS Code and a complete local web-serving environment, [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), setting
  you up with web server, database, and application programming language in one configuration.

  - [XAMPP Tutoral](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/tools/xampp-tutorial-create-your-own-local-test-server/) - this will guide you through configuration and getting a Hello, World working in PHP.
