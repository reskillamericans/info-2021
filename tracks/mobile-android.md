## Week 3 Courses (March 28 - April 3)

- **Basic Introduction to Java Programming**<br>
  There are 4 videos to watch followed by a test in this course.
  
  *Note from Mike: Java
  is the grand-daddy of modern programming languages (2nd only to C and C++ for historical significance).  For that reason, Java has been the primary education language at US Universities for over a decade.  A strong foundation in Java is highly applicable beyond Android app development as well.*

Our mentors will be able to answer any questions you have from this video as well.
