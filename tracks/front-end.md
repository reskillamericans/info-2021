## Week 3 Courses (March 28 - April 3)

*Note from Mike: Please do be sure to give enough attention to last week's HTML and CSS Introduction.  It is a **core** part of your understanding.  I recommend completing that before tackling Git or JavaScript this week - it's really the most important foundation for your training.  The Google Home page assignment from that course will be due this week.*

- **Introduction to Cloud Computing**<br>
  *Note that the test may require doing some independent research
  to answer all the questions.  Feel free to use Google to help.*
- **Introduction to JavaScript Syntax**<br>
  This week's course explains some of the basics of JavaScript.  There are
  two in-line tests, and two assesments to complete at the end.
- **Basic Git for complete beginners.**<br>
  Explains the Git version control system and Github (in more depth
  than last week's Introduction to Programming course).
  - [Git 01 - Introduction - 11 minutes](https://youtu.be/dI_CUlVKrFw)
  - [Git 02 - Pushing to GitHub - 16 minutes](https://youtu.be/0FaJF4t5Kfo)
  - [Git 03 - Cloning and Pushing to GitHub - 15 minutes](https://youtu.be/2chNGl5RGy4)
  - [Git 04 - GitHub Desktop - 8 minutes](https://youtu.be/YUkoy0PlTFQ) - *a graphical user interface option to the command line git.*

  **Assignment**: Create a github repo the same name as your github username (this will later be your online portfolio).
- *Note the Google Home page assignment from last week is due this
   week if you've not yet finished it.*

  ***Supplemental Content***

  Here's a really nice [github cheat sheet](../cheat-sheets/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) you should keep by your computer when using git.

  Mike created a couple of videos demonstrating Git and GitHub if you are still feeling unsure about it.

  [Git Demo - 28 minutes](https://youtu.be/RjGRfYAesFw) - Walk through creating a GitHub account, making a repo on GitHub, and doing some commands on the command line to update it.

  [Git Demo Office Hours - 45 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zXiwnwde9g) - Going through the excercise of connecting to the same repository on github and making and merging two branches.

## Week 2 Courses (March 21 - 27)

This week participants begin working with the [Learning Managment System (LMS)](https://reskillamericans.us).

- **Introduction to HTML and CSS**.<br>
  This course teaches you to set up your development environment,
  learn basic HTML and CSS syntax, and explains some best practices.

  - [Learn HTML Interactive Tutorial](https://www.learn-html.org/) - Work excercises Hello, World through Pseudo-classes (9 excercises).  These are quick introductions to the various components of HTML and CSS languages.
    - [Hello, World](https://www.learn-html.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21) covers tags `<html>, <head>, <body>, <title>, <p>`
    - [Basic Elements](https://www.learn-html.org/en/Basic_Elements) mentions tags `<h1> .. <h6>, <p>, <hr>, <a>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <img>, <div>, <span>` and attributes `id, class, style`
    - [Links](https://www.learn-html.org/en/Links) covers the `<a>` tag and the `href` attribute.
    - [Lists](https://www.learn-html.org/en/Lists) covers tags `<ol>, <ul>, <li>` and style `list-style-type`.
    - [Images](https://www.learn-html.org/en/Images) covers the `<img>` tag and the `src, width, style and alt` attributes.  The CSS `float` property is introduced.
    - [Styles](https://www.learn-html.org/en/Styles) explains inline styles vs style sheets.  Covers the `<style> and <link>` tags and the `rel` attribute.  The `<script>` tag is mentioned for inserting inline JavaScript.
    - [CSS Classes](https://www.learn-html.org/en/Classes) explains how styles can be assigned to elements with named `class` attributes.
    - [CSS Selectors](https://www.learn-html.org/en/Selectors) describes the powerful "query" capability of CSS to match elements in an HTML document.  Covers use of the `class` and `id` HTML attributes.
    - [Pseudo-classes](https://www.learn-html.org/en/Pseudo-classes) shows special classes for visited links, and changing style when hovering the cursor over an element.  Introduces the `<input>` tag and using the `:link, :visited, :target, :active, :hover, and :focus` pseudo-classes.`

  - [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) is a very extensive 12-lesson book-length course.  It goes into everything covered in the previous reference in great detail.  Recommend you look at all 12 "Lessons" (chapters) to be familiar with the concepts.  Lessons 1 - 4 are especially relevant to the assignment, so pay most attention to those.  Save the link to use this as a reference while doing the assignment.

- **Software Development Life Cycle**. *Video and short quiz explaining how software teams organize their work.*
