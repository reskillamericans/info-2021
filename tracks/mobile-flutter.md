## Week 2 Courses (March 21 - 27)

This week participants begin working with the [Learning Managment System (LMS)](https://reskillamericans.us).

- **Environment Setup for Mobile Development**<br>
  This course walks you through setting up Java, Android Studio, and then Flutter.  Flutter has a "doctor" command you can use to confirm everything
  is installed correctly.  Videos are provided for Windows, Mac, Linux, and
  Chromebook installation!<br>
  *Note:
  [Flutter can be installed on a Chromebook](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/chromeos),
  but we don't have the video for that here.*

  **Assignment**: Upload the output of your `flutter doctor -v` command to show your correct installation.
- **Software Development Life Cycle**. *Video and short quiz explaining how software teams organize their work.*

  ***Supplemental Content***<br>
  Some people have trouble with the English accent of the video on the LMS.  This video has pretty much the same content and you may find it easier to watch.<br>
  [Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - 9 minutes](https://youtu.be/i-QyW8D3ei0)
