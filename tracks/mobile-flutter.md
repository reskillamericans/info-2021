  More in-depth descriptions of *Abstraction*, *Encapsulation*, and *Polymorphism* and *Interfaces*.

  **A 5 question test here.**

  - [Mixins in Dart - 14 minutes](https://youtu.be/pJHTyhzt9JU)

  **Assignment**: Create an interface describing an abstract class and implement a class using that interface.  Upload screenshot of code and output.

## Week 4 Courses (April 4 - 10)

*This week's regular courses were released on Wednesday, April 7.  *

- **Dart Functions**<br>
  Explains the role of functions, argument passing, and return values in Dart programs.

  - Explanation of arguments and another 4 question test.

  **Assignment:** Upload a screenshot of the 4 requested functions in your editor and the console output.<br>
  *Note: You can use [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev) or your local VSCode editor to do this.*

- **Dart: Object Oriented Programming**<br>
   Object Oriented programs use features of the language to help organize code into discrete units (called Objects - or Classes).

   This course will explain the features of Object Oriented programming: *Abstraction*, *Encapsulation*, *Inheritance*, and *Polymorphism*.

  - [Object Oriented Programming in Dart and Flutter - 15 minutes](https://youtu.be/apIaNRp7_rs)
  - [Introduction to Dart - Part 3: Classes - 31 minutes](https://youtu.be/9Qi-mNYxRQI) - followed by a 4 question test.
  - [Dart Inheritance- 8 minutes](https://youtu.be/IPoHzLZZu08)

  **Assignment:** Build a *Class* for a bank account.  Implement *methods* to check the balance, make a deposit, and make a withdrawal.  Use `print` function to display status messages on the console as described in the assignment.  Your example should include some test code run from the `main` functions demonstrating each of the required features.

  Here's a really nice [github cheat sheet](../cheat-sheets/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) you should keep by your computer when using git.

  Mike created a couple of videos demonstrating Git and GitHub if you are still feeling unsure about it.

  [Git Demo - 28 minutes](https://youtu.be/RjGRfYAesFw) - Walk through creating a GitHub account, making a repo on GitHub, and doing some commands on the command line to update it.

## Week 2 Courses (March 21 - 27)

This week participants begin working with the [Learning Managment System (LMS)](https://reskillamericans.us).

- **Environment Setup for Mobile Development**<br>
  This course walks you through setting up Java, Android Studio, and then Flutter.  Flutter has a "doctor" command you can use to confirm everything
  is installed correctly.  Videos are provided for Windows, Mac, Linux, and
  Chromebook installation!<br>
  *Note:
  [Flutter can be installed on a Chromebook](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/chromeos),
  but we don't have the video for that here.*

  **Assignment**: Upload the output of your `flutter doctor -v` command to show your correct installation.
- **Software Development Life Cycle**. *Video and short quiz explaining how software teams organize their work.*

  ***Supplemental Content***<br>
  Some people have trouble with the English accent of the video on the LMS.  This video has pretty much the same content and you may find it easier to watch.<br>
  [Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - 9 minutes](https://youtu.be/i-QyW8D3ei0)
- **Introduction to Programming**.  *Explains computer programming essentials.*
  - Introduction to Programming Section<br>
