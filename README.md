# Program Status

If you want to reference past-completed courses, they may look like they disappeared on your LMS home page.  Try clicking the Completed Courses button to see if they are there.

We are entering week 4 of the program this week.  If you are keeping up you should:

- Be logging into [Slack](reskillamericans.slack.com) to check **#announcements**.
- Login to the [LMS](reskillamericans.us) (Learning Management System)
- Selected a Track to focus on and entered the code from **#announcements** to join the LMS group
  for that track.
- Completed your 3rd week's assignments.  If you are not done, you will have until Saturday,
  April 10th, to complete them.

**NOTICE**: It's very important that you **complete the Courses assigned to you on time**.  New
courses are usually added to your LMS each Saturday, and you should complete them by the following Saturday.
If you fail to complete them, you will have a one week grace period.  But after that time, **you
will no longer be able to participate in our program with unfinished assignments.** *If you do not
get a passing grade in an assignment, you can take the test again until you pass.*

*In any event - you will always have a whole week from the time an assigment is given, to it being due.
And you will be given 1 week after that as a grace period if you miss the due date.*

# Program Outline

Welcome to our program!  The general outline of our course spans seven
months.  During that time we will be:

- 2 months: Course Work
- 2 months: Project based learning
- 3 months: "Virtual" Internship

We officially starting the program on March 15th, with a final registration
deadline of March 7, 2021.  We published a [Syllabus Summary](syllabus-summary.pdf) in early March.

# Communication and Sites

## How to Get the Quickest Response

We are working hard to make sure we are as responsive as possible to everyone's needs to get questions answered, and get help.  There are different expectations about how responsive we will be able to be, depending on where you ask the question.  This is our SLA (Service Level Agreement) for these different communication channels.

- **Post to a channel called track-X**.  This is the BEST way to get a quick response.  The reason being that your peers may be able to help you as well as our mentors and instructors.  You can expect a response is under **1 hour** by a peer, and under **5 hours** by a mentor. 
- **Post to the #mentor-help channel**.  All mentors monitor this channel for general questions.  Please only use this if your questions isn't specific to a track-X channel that has been setup.  (e.g., please ask questions about CSS on #track-frontend-html-css instead of #mentor-help).  You can expect a response in under **5 hours**.
- If a **specific mentor** is helping you, you can continue to send them a dm (private message).  But note that we do have some time-zone variance - so they may be sleeping when you are awake.  Expect a response to dm's in under **24 hours**.  Similarly, you can use the messaging system on the LMS to communicate with your course instructors - be sure to select the "(Only Instructor)" option for the recipient.  *This list of mentors and instructors is in the track-specific course notes linked from https://reskillamericans.github.io/info-2021/*
- **Post to #help-desk** if you have a problem with you login to the LMS, or some other administrative system giving you problems.  Please don't post questions about the courses here as mentors may not see it.  You can expect a response in **24 hours**.
- If you have not gotten a response within the above time frames, please **escalate to @xyluz**.  Especially for issues related to instructors or mentors not being reachable.  It is possible that your message just got lost in the shuffle and needs to be prioritized.  You can expect a response in **24 hours**.
- You can **escalate messages to @Juwon O or @Mike Koss if** all the above have not been able to address your problem.    If Slack is not available, or you prefer you can also send email to info@reskillamericans.org.  We will respond within **24 hours**.

Thanks for your help in helping us optimize your experience and get the quickest response possible.

## Slack

All participants have been invited to join our slack channel:

> [ReskillAmericans Slack Channel](https://reskillamericans.slack.com)

Participation in the program is conditional on your adherence to our
[Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

We have set up the following channels on Slack:

- **#announce**: Announcements from organizers for any program information
  or upcoming events.
- **#help-desk**: Use to ask questions if you have problems accessing course material
  or other administrative questions.
- **#introductions**: Introduce yourself here to your fellow participants.  Good place
  to seek our regional study partners, etc.
- **#mentor-help**: General questions about software development issues.  E.g. setting
  up your computer, installing software, using Git, using VS-Code.
- **#projects-feedback**: Once we start implementing projects, this will be a place you
  can show off your work, and get your peers to give you feedback.

### Regional Study Groups

Feel free to join a smaller community of participants in your area.

- **#study-group-atlanta**
- **#study-group-austin** 
- **#study-group-birmingham**
- **#study-group-boston**
- **#study-group-ca**: California
- **#study-group-chicago**
- **#study-group-charlotte**
- **#study-group-dallas** 
- **#study-group-dmv**: DC, Maryland, and Virginia
- **#study-group-florida**
- **#study-group-houston**
- **#study-group-new-york**
- **#study-group-seattle**

- **#study-group-novices**: There are **no** stupid questions anywhere.
  But, if you'd like to join a study group of self-identifying
  "novices" - here you go.

### Track Specific Channels

For participants that have chosen a track, the best place to ask questions is in
one of the track specific channels (if you're having a question, it's likely others
in your group are having a similar one).

Your instructors and mentors will be monitoring these channels for questions.

***If you know the answer to another participant's question, please feel free to
help out and answer it - there are many more participants than mentors so it
is very appreciated when others can fill in with timely advice.***

Instructors may also upload content to YouTube for you to use as part of your Track.  Links to these videos
will be posted in Slack or the LMS.
  
## Talent LMS (Learning Management System)
  
The primary course material, schedule, and assignments are all on

Each Track will be assigned a Group Code (published in **#announcments**).  Use this
code to **Join Group** in the LMS.  This will then unlock a set of additional *Courses*
specific to your track.

New assignments will be released each Saturday and due the following Saturday.  There
is a one-week grace period if you fall behind on completing assignments.
