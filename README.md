# Program Status

We are entering week 3 of the program this week.  If you are keeping up
you should:

- Be logging into [Slack](reskillamericans.slack.com) to check **#announcements**.
- Login to the [LMS](reskillamericans.us) (Learning Management System)
- Selected a Track to focus on and entered the code from **#announcements** to join the LMS group
  for that track.
- Completed your first week's assignments.  If you are not done, you will have until Saturday,
  April 3rd, to complete them.

**NOTICE**: It's very important that you **complete the Courses assigned to you on time**.  New
courses are added to your LMS each Saturday, and you should complete them by the following Saturday.
If you fail to complete them, you will have a one week grace period.  But after that time, **you
will no longer be able to participate in our program with unfinished assignments.** *If you do not
get a passing grade in an assignment, you can take the test again until you pass.*

# Program Outline

Welcome to our program!  The general outline of our course spans seven
months.  During that time we will be:

- 2 months: Course Work
- 2 months: Project based learning

We officially starting the program on March 15th, with a final registration
deadline of March 7, 2021.  We published a [Syllabus Summary](syllabus-summary.pdf) in
early March.

# Communication and Sites

## Slack

All participants have been invited to join our slack channel:

> [ReskillAmericans Slack Channel](https://reskillamericans.slack.com)

We have set up the following channels on Slack:

- **#announce**: Announcements from organizers for any program information
  or upcoming events.
- **#help-desk**: Use to ask questions if you have problems accessing course material
  or other administrative questions.
- **#introductions**: Introduce yourself here to your fellow participants.  Good place
  to seek our regional study partners, etc.
- **#mentor-help**: General questions about software development issues.  E.g. setting
  up your computer, installing software, using Git, using VS-Code.
- **#projects-feedback**: Once we start implementing projects, this will be a place you
  can show off your work, and get your peers to give you feedback.

### Regional Study Groups

Feel free to join a smaller community of participants in your area.

- **#study-group-atlanta**:
- **#study-group-austin**: 
- **#study-group-birmingham**: 
- **#study-group-boston**: 
- **#study-group-ca**: California

of self-identifying "novices" - here you go.

### Track Specific Channels

For participants that have chosen a track, the best place to ask questions is in
one of the track specific channels (if you're having a question, it's likely others
in your group are having a similar one).

Your instructors and mentors will be monitoring these channels for questions.

***If you know the answer to another participant's question, please feel free to
help out and answer it - there are many more participants than mentors so it
is very appreciated when others can fill in with timely advice.***
