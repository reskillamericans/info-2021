# Communication and Sites

We have set up the following channels on Slack:

  or upcoming events.
- **#help-desk**: Use to ask questions if you have problems accessing course material
  or other administrative questions.
- **#introductions**: Introduce yourself here to your fellow participants.  Good place
  to seek our regional study partners, etc.
- **#mentor-help**: General questions about software development issues.  E.g. setting
  up your computer, installing software, using Git, using VS-Code.
- **#projects-feedback**: Once we start implementing projects, this will be a place you
  can show off your work, and get your peers to give you feedback.

### Track Specific Channels

For participants that have chosen a track, the best place to ask questions is in
one of the track specific channels (if you're having a question, it's likely others
in your group are having a similar one).

Your instructors and mentors will be monitoring these channels for questions.

***If you know the answer to another participant's question, please feel free to
help out and answer it - there are many more participants than mentors so it
is very appreciated when others can fill in with timely advice.***
